#Necessary for MVP#

1. Create a menu of food items with prices.
	- I created some clickable pictures instead of prices, but prices get listed in the calc area

2. The application should allow the user to add items to a receipt.
	- the user will see a lst of the items in the calc area and I also added a click button to print a receipt

3. The application should display and update the running total and tax.
	- this part is covered

4. The application should be nicely styled.
	- this one too

#Reach goals#

5. Add the ability to comp (make free) a food item.
	- I created a free button for this purpose- 

6. Add a tip button that adds 20% tip.
	- I also created a tip button for this

7. Make the menu a bunch of images, that when clicked on, adds that item's name and cost to the bill.
	- yup, that's pretty much what I did

8. Add the feature of calculating how much change to give based on the bill and how much money the customer gives the cashier.
	- an input area takes the ammount and that value gets return minus the total
