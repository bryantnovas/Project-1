#Point of sale web app#
As in you'll find in many restaurants, I created a web app that can calculate the items purchased by a client and it'll do all proper calculations and print receipts.

#How to use:#

- Click on the button that represents the item the client wants to purchase, every time you do so is going to be listed on the right part of the page.

- The program will calculate tax and total automatically but not the tips, if you click the tips button it will give you 20% tips and it'll update all other values as well.

- In the input area the user has to type using only numbers the amount of money the client pays and returns the change that the client will receive if any.

- The free button is designed to make the last item on the list free as a gratuity for the client and updates al the values.

- The paid button asumes that the client paid and all the transactions are done so it will restart the application.

- The print button will print a receipt.
